# H1B-Visa-Prediction

This file is the final class project of Machine Learning course during my graduate study at University of Virginia. It is a H1B visa predictor that can predict "Pass" or "Fail" for a visa application case provided with a set of features. I used 3 different ML algorithms and compared their performance.
